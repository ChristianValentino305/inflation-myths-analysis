# Exploring Inflation Myths

## Project Goals
The goal of this project was to understand commonly held misconceptions that Americans have in regards to inflation. The topic of inflation is dense, and determining exact correlations and/or causation is far outside the scope of a single project. As a result, our group focused on **three** myths that frequently appear within the zeitgeist of American economics:

1. The Federal Government has **direct control over inflation** and **intentionally raises rates** so that housing, cars, and borrowing money is more expensive.
2. The vast amount that America spends on foreign aid has a **high inflationary effect**.
3. The **general public** has **little or no** effect on the inflation of the American dollar.

This repository serves to demonstrate the iterative process our group made within the various charts and graphs that were included in the final report (located [here](https://medium.com/@chva5992/debunking-common-inflation-myths-002e403c623e)) . Any and all datasets that were used are also located within this repository.
